# Steps to Add a Remote Repository and Push Your Code

## Option 1: GitHub

If you're using GitHub:

1. Create a new repository on GitHub: https://github.com/new
   - Choose a repository name (e.g., "jira-productivity-ui")
   - Make it public or private as needed
   - Do NOT initialize with a README, .gitignore, or license

2. Copy the repository URL provided by GitHub after creation (e.g., https://github.com/yourusername/jira-productivity-ui.git)

3. Add the remote repository by running:
   ```
   git remote add origin https://github.com/yourusername/jira-productivity-ui.git
   ```
   (Replace the URL with your actual repository URL)

4. Push your code to GitHub:
   ```
   git push -u origin feature/ui
   ```

## Option 2: Other Git Hosting (GitLab, Bitbucket, etc.)

1. Create a new repository on your Git hosting service
2. Copy the repository URL provided
3. Add the remote repository:
   ```
   git remote add origin YOUR_REPOSITORY_URL
   ```
4. Push your code:
   ```
   git push -u origin feature/ui
   ```

## Option 3: Setting Up a Repository on a Server

If you're using a self-hosted Git server:

1. Add the remote repository:
   ```
   git remote add origin ssh://user@server/path/to/repo.git
   ```
   or
   ```
   git remote add origin https://server/path/to/repo.git
   ```

2. Push your code:
   ```
   git push -u origin feature/ui
   ```

After executing the appropriate commands above, your Django UI code will be pushed to the feature/ui branch of your remote repository.
